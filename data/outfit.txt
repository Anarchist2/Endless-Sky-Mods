	description `The Balefire Lance's inner workings are a mystery, but it's effects are not.  The contained field or 'lance' that it projects causes the atoms of any molecule caught within it to spontaneously split from their host molecule and bond with the nearest molecule.  The more durable the material that they're pointed at, the more volatile the reaction is as the energy from the strong molecular bonds is released.`

Instead of projecting a field of the balefire energy in front of your ship like the lance, this device is able to create a field of the energy directly around the enemy ship.  The field is not as intense as the field created by the lance, but the ability to harness this kind of destructive power at range more than makes up for it.`
