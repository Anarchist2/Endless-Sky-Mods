	description `The geometry and subsequently the workings of this technology is incomprehensible to any outsider. Surprisingly however, it seems hardly as effective on any ship other than the Revelation. It seems much of the engines were designed specifically for the Revelation in mind, to work in perfect conjunction with the ships peripherals and core components.`

Apparently this application of cloaking is crude and undeveloped but in enough of a working state to function effectively, although slow to put into effect and demanding on your ships power reserves.`
