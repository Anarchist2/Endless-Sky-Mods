Those animals that do walk the land however are large, lumbering beasts that easily dwarf small buildings. The most dominant species is noticeably creatures resembling old earth humans, they boast a very large build and move cautiously in groups.`

Surrounding the spire are densely populated residential and industrial sectors. The lower airspace of the city and lower levels of the spire are utilized for use by some form of flight capable vehicle, presumably for transit for the wealthy.`
	spaceport `It appears as though only the very top regions of the spire are intended for foreigners to land, however there are docking bays located at various points around each docking level. Apparently only the most fortunate of Aben ever make it to the top of the spire, it's regarded as the highest honor to be of the few individuals to greet visiting species.`
planet Pesek
	description `A lifeless rock with a very thin atmosphere, slightly smaller than the Aben homeworld Nis.

	description `The colonies sole purpose on this planet appears to be the research and development of the advanced technology they are given. With many flashes of light and booming sounds from off-site locations along the planets surface, the feel for the intensity of research is very intense.`
