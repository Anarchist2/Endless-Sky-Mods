planet "Pug Kaelin"
	"required reputation" 2
	description `This Pug world seems to fit with the other Pug worlds that you know of, presumably they are all outposts. Large cities with towers of indescribable design encompass a large portion of the main continent. The remainder of the planet remains practically untouched by anything not native to this planet, as if the Pug cities were simply lowered down onto the land rather than built up over time.`

	spaceport `The spaceport here can be described no other way than impressive, it is the largest tower, placed directly central of the gargantuan city. With a base almost looking big enough to pass as a sizable village, very quickly getting thinner as it raises into the cities airspace.`
	spaceport `Reaching unimaginable heights many would consider impossible, the tower is more than the planets spaceport, it is quite literally the epicenter for everything from logistics to residence.`
planet "Relic Station"
	description `Everything here is enigmatic and frankly alien. The passageways are incomprehensibly large and the walkways are guided by unbroken blinding lights that follow up the edges of the doorways.`
	description `Mazes of endless halls and slated walls seem designed to disorient visitors. It would be easy to lose yourself here, both your person and your mind.`
