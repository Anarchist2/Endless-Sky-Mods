planet "Relic Station"
	description `Everything here is enigmatic and frankly alien. The passageways are incomprehensibly large and the walkways are guided by unbroken blinding lights that follow up the edges of the doorways.`
	description `Mazes of endless halls and slated walls seem designed to disorient visitors. It would be easy to lose yourself here, both your person and your mind.`
