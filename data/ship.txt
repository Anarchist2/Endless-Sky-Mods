	description `The next step in the evolution of the Kor Mereti war-machine is the Model 1024, somewhat improved beyond a perfect ring. Sporting minimal armament with a sudden conversion to a cargo hauling vessel, this was obviously developed after the Kor Mereti gained sapience and diverted their focus to less self-destructive endeavors.`
