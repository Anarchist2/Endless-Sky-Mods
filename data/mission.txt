			`	"A great calamity befell this species long ago, they regressed to a state of disrepair that rendered them helpless to the challenges they would otherwise find trivial." As the voice says this, a pain reveals itself within your mind, as if a cancer is spreading at an unprecedented rate, you feel as though all your past experiences are fading with it's presence.`
			choice
				`	"What is happening?!"`
				`	"Why are you doing this!"`
			`	Your processes are slowing and then reorienting, things feel different, as though you are no longer the same person. You make your desperate pleas for salvation, for help. Dark figures linger in the shadows but you don't see them, you can't see, and they are whispering, waiting.`
			choice
				`	"I know what you are!"`
				`	"Stop hiding from me!"`
			`	The shadows grow, reaching for you, grasping for what the light abandons, waiting. The darkness ensues and you submit, reaching for the man in the corner.`
			`	"Be gone, quick." the voice says. The cancer within your head seems to fall away, and you are left talking to thin air, with no more than a hazy experience to carry with you. Perhaps it was a warning.`

We regret to send you alone to deal with our matters given the risk, but we will compensate you greatly for your efforts."`

Of course, big ships can ward of these effects much longer than a smaller ship can, it's always been a notable issue with the orginal design, but it is a hell of a lot more impressive."`
