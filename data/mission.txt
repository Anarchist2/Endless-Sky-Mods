			`A voice says, "This system is restricted. You should stay away."`

			`	You feel a massive rush through your body, as if drowning under some inexplicable emotion. "Human, you would regret ignoring the reservations of the Drak. I am here to tend to the minds of the Forsaken, and they must not be disturbed during their healing. You would fare better to leave me to my task and continue your ill-fated journey."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean, 'tend to the minds of the Forsaken'?"`
				`	"What happened to the Forsaken?"`
			`	"A great calamity befell this species long ago, they regressed to a state of disrepair that rendered them helpless to the challenges they would otherwise find trivial." As the voice says this, a pain reveals itself within your mind, as if a cancer is spreading at an unprecedented rate, you feel as though all your past experiences are fading with it's presence.`
			choice
				`	"What is happening?!"`
				`	"Why are you doing this!"`
			`	Your processes are slowing and then reorienting, things feel different, as though you are no longer the same person. You make your desperate pleas for salvation, for help. Dark figures linger in the shadows but you don't see them, you can't see, and they are whispering, waiting.`
			choice
				`	"I know what you are!"`
				`	"Stop hiding from me!"`
			`	The shadows grow, reaching for you, grasping for what the light abandons, waiting. The darkness ensues and you submit, reaching for the man in the corner.`
			`	"Be gone, quick." the voice says. The cancer within your head seems to fall away, and you are left talking to thin air, with no more than a hazy experience to carry with you. Perhaps it was a warning.`

				goto available
			label damage
			`	"Well, you are famous for a reason I suppose." he says. "The idea is that by shrinking the concentrations of superheated plasma we can offload many more bursts onto a target, the effects on said target result in faster build up of heat and of course damage. Of course, big ships can ward of these effects much longer than a smaller ship can, it's always been a notable issue with the orginal design, but it is a hell of a lot more impressive."`

We've got a new weapon, something that could have helped our chances during the war had we finished prototyping just a little earlier."`
			`	"Of course," you say.`
			`	"Great," he says. "You shouldn't notice too much out of the ordinary other than meeting the Warlock in orbit, it has been fitted with a few of these new weapons. Your job will be to fight it and disable it, then tell us what you think of its weapons."`
			`	He shakes a finger in your face and says, "Now mind you, we just want you to disable the Warlock, not destroy it. We've recommissioned it from retirement, so it's not top of the line, but all the same I want to be able to keep using it for future tests. Understood?"`
