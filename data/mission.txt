			`On your descent you are provided with a fantastic view of the surrounding city, everything has a sort of overwhelming industrial appearance. Though offset by the distinct lack of pollution in the air, it is a sight to behold. Even more perplexing is the magnitude of the ringworld; you can't begin to fathom the amount of work it would take to create even this small, tightly knit portion of the ring.`
			`	Being greeted by a large group of security personnel on landing has you uneasy, even more so with the escort of several security drones. The one leading the group advances towards you slowly, and says something in an alien language that you do not understand. Noticing your expression, they offer a small metallic device, presumably some sort of translation device.`

			label take
			`	After taking the device, the group turns and begins to walk away from you, that was a quick meeting. You should try to find some place that could tell you about what you've just taken.`

		log Factions Irm `The Irm is an inward facing technocratic society, their entire civilization is undertaking the construction of a truly breathtaking megastructure. Although they very obviously despise cooperating with other species due to a lack of trust and no willingness to give them the chance to prove their trust, they have traded with the Hai before whilst observing the rise and fall of the mighty Hai empire.`

			`When landing back on the massive ringworld, it is no less impressive as it was the first time around. Back to greet you are the same group of individuals from last time, "Greetings, your translation device seems to be fully functioning now. We are the Irm, I understand you must have questions."`

			`	"Yes, though not through means of exploration, they came to us. At the beginning we were threatened, extorted of our resources, a time where we had not yet even discovered the atom. Though for very many millennia since, we have had peace with the Hai, our negotiations with the peaceful Hai were extensive, they do not permit their kind to wander here, and they do not tell of our existence to outsiders, like them we mean to keep peace and this has earned us their favor."`

Whichever is the cause, we do not mind, we have many pressing matters that take precedence over tourism. If you wish to explore our home you are welcome but do not become an issue to us or you will no longer be welcome here."`
